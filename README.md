"52 programming problem and solution" is a  book . Tamim Shahriar Shubeen, rafi and rini are the Authors of this book. This book is based on 52 Problem.
Subeen Vai and his team are very easily explain all 52 programming problem and how to submit the problem vaya online. Though nowadays has lot's of references and books but I think this book is also good for beginner. 

# what I have to do?

I just try to commit all 52 problems solution here. Many of them might helps but one more thing we have to follow that we should not find source code at begining of each problem. We have to read carefully what the problem is and what we have to find. I would like to request you to please copy the sources when you are unable and you invest many attempt.
